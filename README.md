# Galactic Conflict Test Build
Test build for the Star Wars conversion pack to Age of Empires III, intended to be shared only to trustyworthy modders

Installation:

This build uses UHC's patch and the .exe ignores registry path, so you are able to download this build and extract to whatever path you wish (don't replace the original Age of Empires III instalation, that's the idea behind ignoring the registry path, afterall). However, due to github's policy of not allowing sizes above 25MB to be imported, most .BAR files are missing, and you must copy them from your original AoE3 install path to your mod path.

Copy Art1.bar, Art2.bar, Art3.bar, Art4.bar and Art5.bar from your (Age of Empires III install directory)/art to (Mod directory)/art
Copy Sound.bar, Sound2.bar, and Sound3.bar from your (Age of Empires III install directory)/Sound to (Mod directory)/Sound
Copy Data.bar, Data2.bar, and Data3.bar from your (Age of Empires III install directory)/data to (Mod directory)/data
